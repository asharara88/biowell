# Maximizing Your Wearable Data: A Complete Guide to Biometric Tracking

Learn how to interpret and act on your health metrics for optimal wellness outcomes.

## Understanding Your Metrics

### Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
HRV is a key indicator of your body's recovery and stress levels. Higher variability generally indicates better recovery capacity and stress resilience.

Key ranges:
- Below 20ms: Poor recovery
- 20-40ms: Fair recovery
- 40-60ms: Good recovery
- Above 60ms: Excellent recovery

### Glucose Monitoring
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) provides insights into your metabolic health and energy patterns.

Target ranges:
- Fasting: 70-99 mg/dL
- Post-meal: Below 140 mg/dL
- Daily average: 70-120 mg/dL

### Sleep Metrics
Quality sleep is fundamental to recovery and performance.

Key indicators:
- Deep sleep: 15-25% of total sleep time
- REM sleep: 20-25% of total sleep time
- Sleep efficiency: Above 85%
